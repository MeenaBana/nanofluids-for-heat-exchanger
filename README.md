# Nanofluids for Heat Exchangers

## Project Overview
This repository contains research on nanofluids with a focus on ZnO nanoparticles and their application in heat transfer technology. The project explores the thermal properties, preparation methods, and practical applications of nanofluids in heat exchangers.
This project was conducted as part of the "Materials in energy technology" course in the Master in Green Energy Technology program at Østfold University College.

## What are Nanofluids?

Nanofluids are colloidal suspensions of nanoparticles in a base fluid. These engineered fluids show enhanced thermal properties compared to conventional heat transfer fluids like water, ethylene glycol, or propylene glycol. The nanoparticles used are typically made from:
- Metal oxides (like ZnO, Al₂O₃)
- Carbides
- Carbon nanotubes
- Metals

## Key Findings on ZnO Nanofluids

The research focused specifically on ZnO-based nanofluids and found:

1. **Enhanced Thermal Conductivity**: The thermal conductivity of ZnO nanofluids increases with:
   - Higher concentration of nanoparticles
   - Increased temperature
   - Specific particle shapes and sizes

2. **Heat Transfer Coefficient**: ZnO nanofluids exhibit significantly higher heat transfer coefficients compared to base fluids, with enhancements of up to 32% in certain configurations.

3. **Advantages of ZnO Nanoparticles**:
   - Lower cost compared to many alternatives
   - Reduced toxicity
   - Can be produced via biosynthesis from plant materials
   - Good stability with proper preparation

## Preparation Methods

Nanofluids can be prepared using two main approaches:

1. **Two-step method**: (Most common)
   - First, produce nanoparticles as dry powder
   - Then disperse them into the base fluid
   
2. **Single-step method**: 
   - Simultaneous production and dispersion of nanoparticles

## Applications

Nanofluids have potential applications in:
- Heat exchangers
- Refrigeration systems
- Engine cooling
- Solar thermal systems
- Electronic cooling
- Industrial heating/cooling
